This app was made using VITE, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, React Router, Redux Toolkit, Axios, and React Query.

It's a little bit about the functionality of this app:
You can register and log in to the app or be a guest user, select products by amount, color, and several filters, browse through the pages using pagination and add them to your cart.
In the cart, you can change the amount or remove items, check shipping, tax, and total, then go to the checkout where you will need to enter your name and address and then place your order. After that, your order will appear in all orders where you can check names, addresses, amounts, costs, and dates.
And you can also switch between light and dark themes.
